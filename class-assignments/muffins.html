        Hi. My Name is Muffins. I am a mighty cat. I was adopted by my family when i was only 3 weeks old <br>
        
        My new mommy is a human. They are funny creatures. <br>
        
        I left the pound with my new mommy and new sister, Maria. They took me straight to the pet store to buy:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
        <li>A smalkl cloth toy</li>
        <li>Litter box with litter</li>
        <li>Food (for later)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mom and sis had to feed me by bottle because I was so young</p>
